#### More Info

-Seven or eight is typically the max number of notes in a chord.
-351 possible chord variations
-The sharp (♯), the flat (♭) and the natural (♮).
-Scenario: - C Eb e () app should try to find the chord name by switching bass note
-This chord is Eb6sus2\C (Broader chord finding by switching bass note)
Sus2 and sus4 chords.

The pitch middle C is C4, which is useful to memorize.

The notes (C, C# or Db, D, D# or Eb, D, F, F# or Gb, G, G# or Ab, A# or Bb, B) are followed by an octave number. For example: C2, F#3, and Bb4. These may also be written in various publications as: C(2), F#(3), Bb(4), C[2], F#[3], Bb[4], or C2, F#3, and Bb4.

The reason the keyboard is designed around the C major scale does not come from piano - it started with the organ. Organ builders discovered long ago that a pipe of 8 feet will give a note close to the pitch called C. This was a convenient place to start

An octave C4 despite the way it looks c1 still goes to b1 (even tho these are not in order)

#### Inversions:

- Need to derive the 3rd 5th and 7th from the chord name (presumably break all tones into a major scale and count up from the root note)
- chords are derived from scales
